This project focuses on developing a recommendation engine for Netflix, the leading video streaming platform with millions of subscribers worldwide. The goal is to leverage data and create an advanced recommendation system that enhances user experience, increases user engagement, and attracts new subscribers.

## Project Context

With intense competition from other streaming platforms like Disney+, Prime Video, and many others, Netflix aims to continuously grow its subscriber base. To achieve this, they recognize the importance of a robust recommendation engine that can provide personalized recommendations to keep users entertained and engaged on the platform.

## Project Goals

As a team of Machine Learning Engineers, the goals for this project are as follows:

1. **Create a Recommendation Engine:** Develop a recommendation engine using any AI library of your choice. The engine should analyze user interactions and preferences to generate relevant and personalized recommendations.

2. **Real-time User Interaction Tracking:** Build an infrastructure that can capture and ingest real-time user interactions on the platform. This infrastructure should seamlessly collect data on user activities, such as movies watched, ratings given, and other relevant interactions.

3. **Real-time Recommendation Generation:** Implement a system that can automatically produce real-time recommendations for users once they finish watching a movie. The recommendation engine should utilize the collected user interaction data to generate personalized recommendations based on user preferences and behavior.

## Data Sources

To accomplish this project, you have two data sources available:

1. **Netflix Prize Data:** This dataset provides a significant amount of information on user activities and preferences. You can explore the existing work done by data scientists in this field and leverage their findings to build your own recommendation algorithm. Use this dataset to train and fine-tune your recommendation engine.

2. **Jedha x Netflix Real-time User Interactions API:** This API enables you to retrieve real-time data on movie watched by users. Utilize this API to capture and process the latest user interactions and generate real-time predictions and recommendations.
